Along this theme we follow Underwood, a power-hungry Democratic congressman from South Carolina and House majority whip. After securing the election of President Garrett Walker to get himself appointed to Secretary of State, Underwood is devastated to learn that he is being passed over. Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez tells Underwood that the president wants him to promote his agenda in Congress and will not honor their agreement. Inwardly seething, Underwood quickly gains control of his anger and hides his disappointment to present himself as a helpful lieutenant to the president and his agenda. In reality, Underwood begins an elaborate plan behind the president\u0027s back, with the ultimate goal of gaining power for himself.\r\n\r\nFrank\u0027s wife Claire runs an NGO, the Clean Water Initiative (\u0022CWI\u0022), but her intentions are not made explicit. She seems to use her charity to cultivate her own power and influence, yet its ultimate purpose remains unknown. In the opening episode, she deems the otherwise-successful charity to have too limited a footprint. Keen to be on the international stage, she decides to change her organization to one that supports international well-digging to provide clean water. This is met with great misgivings by her office manager. Claire directs her to fire CWI employees, cutting the staff by half. At the end of the day, she checks in to ask how the process went and then informs the manager she is being let go as well. It is clear from the outset that Claire shares both her husband\u0027s cold-hearted, ruthless pragmatism and his lust for power.\r\n\r\nUnderwood begins a highly intricate plan to obtain a cabinet position, acquiring pawns he can manipulate in his power play. He begins a symbiotic, and ultimately sexual, relationship with Zoe Barnes, an ambitious young political reporter, and then makes a deal with her that she will publish damaging stories he leaks about his political rivals. Meanwhile, he manipulates Peter Russo, a troubled congressman from Pennsylvania, into helping him undermine Walker\u0027s pick for Secretary of State, Senator Michael Kern. Underwood eventually has Kern replaced with his own choice, Senator Catherine Durant. Underwood also uses Russo in a plot to end a teachers\u0027 strike and pass an education bill, which improves Underwood\u0027s standing with President Walker.\r\n\r\nBecause the new Vice President is the former governor of Pennsylvania, a special election is to be held for governor. Underwood helps Russo get clean and props up his candidacy but later uses call girl Rachel Posner to break his sobriety and trigger his downfall shortly before the election, by Russo\u0027s being drunk while appearing on a radio interview. Distraught, Russo decides to make amends for his failure by coming clean to the press about his role in Underwood\u0027s schemes. In response, Frank kills Russo by leaving him passed out in a closed garage with Russo\u0027s car running, asphyxiating him. With the Pennsylvania special election in chaos, Underwood convinces the vice president to step down and run for his old position of governor \u2013 leaving the vice presidency open to Underwood, as was his plan all along.\r\n\r\nPresident Walker appears to have other plans, however. Underwood ends up vetting a surprising choice for vice president: Missouri billionaire Raymond Tusk. Tusk later reveals that he is actually appraising Underwood for the position and has been friends with Walker for years (it was Tusk who had suggested that Walker break his agreement to make Underwood Secretary of State). Tusk explains he will influence Walker to nominate Underwood if Underwood agrees to perform \u0022favors\u0022 for him that benefit Tusk\u0027s policy interests. Underwood, after some thought, counterproposes to Tusk that they work together to fulfill both their interests, and Tusk accepts. Meanwhile, after Underwood ends their affair, Zoe begins piecing together clues about Underwood\u0027s scheming. The season ends when Underwood receives and accepts the nomination for vice president.","created":1447207283,"changed":1447207939,"release_date":1447160400,"images":{"icon":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/sites\/default\/files\/Frank_Underwood_-_House_of_Cardss1.jpg"},"series":{"id":63,"title":"House of Cards","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/series\/63"}}},"episodes":[{"id":73,"title":"Chapter 1","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/episode\/73"}}},{"id":77,"title":"House Of Cards S01E01","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/episode\/77"}}}]},{"id":67,"label":"Season 2 (2014)","uuid":"965f3304-f4b5-473e-8dd6-dd0fdfadf929","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/seasons\/67"}},"body":"The second season of the American television drama series House of Cards began filming a set of 13 episodes on April 29, 2013 and concluded on November 8. Filming occurred primarily in Baltimore. On December 4, 2013, Netflix announced that the season would be released in its entirety on February 14, 2014. Set in current day Washington, D.C., season two deals with topics such as entitlement reform, Chinese cyberespionage, anthrax scares, Senate parliamentary procedure, and government shutdowns. It begins at the exact time that season one ended.\r\n\r\nCritics previewed the first four episodes of the season under non-disclosure agreements that they not reveal any spoilers. Reviews began appearing as early as January 31. Many critics who previewed the season noted the first episode was shocking, but withheld the surprises of the four episodes made available for preview. Willa Paskin of Slate broke the embargo nearly a day early revealing several spoilers. Whereas critics had been somewhat split on the propriety of binge-watching the first season, they were more supportive of the practice for season two.\r\n\r\nEarly reviews were largely positive, noting that the second season had a darker tone than the first. Molly Parker was praised as an addition to the cast. Nonetheless, many critics were concerned at the domineering presence of Underwood, who appears to have no worthy adversaries. Viewership of the second season was many times higher than season one. Favorable critical acclaim was garnered as the season earned thirteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and three nominations at both the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. Kevin Spacey won Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama for playing Frank Underwood in season 2. Season 2 of House of Cards was one of the first shows available in 4K video format on Netflix\u0027 streaming service.","created":1447207413,"changed":1447207413,"release_date":1447160400,"images":{"icon":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/sites\/default\/files\/HouseOfCardsSeason2Teaser.jpg"},"series":{"id":63,"title":"House of Cards","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/series\/63"}}},"episodes":null},{"id":69,"label":"House of Cards (season 3)","uuid":"9da32309-523a-4f56-94a6-5fc3914a756b","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/seasons\/69"}},"body":"The third season of the American web television drama series House of Cards was commissioned on February 4, 2014.
