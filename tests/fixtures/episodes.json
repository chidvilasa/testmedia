It premiered on February 1, 2013, when it was released along with the rest of the first season on the American streaming service Netflix. This episode became the first web television webisode to earn Primetime Emmy Awards and nominations. \u0022Chapter 1\u0022 was written by series developer Beau Willimon and directed by executive producer David Fincher. The episode also earned 3 other Emmy nominations as well as WGA: Episodic Drama and DGA \u2013 Drama Series nominations.\r\n\r\nFrank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is an ambitious Democratic congressman and the House Majority Whip. Underwood helped ensure the election of President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), who promised to appoint Underwood as Secretary of State. However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) announces that the president will not honor the agreement and will instead nominate Senator Michael Kern. Furious at Walker\u0027s betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern. When Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) makes her resources available, she becomes one of their pawns.\r\n\r\nThe episode was well received by most television critics. They praised the production values of the series as well as the performances of the lead actors. Spacey received praise for the opening scene. Spacey is distinguished for his Machiavellian character\u0027s use of carnivorous metaphors and widely noted for his character\u0027s narrative technique of presenting dialogue in a direct address to the audience, a technique known as breaking the fourth wall, both of which are introduced quickly in this episode. Similarly, in Wright\u0027s first few scenes she demonstrated a nuanced character that drew numerous Lady Macbeth comparisons from critics. The way the couple plots and executes its revenge is perceived as high drama worthy of critical praise. The episode also presents Mara\u0027s supporting character as naive and desperate. Many critics recommend watching this episode (and all others in the series) as singular viewing experiences, rather than binge-viewed in a continuous session.","video_details":{"thumbnail":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/","manifest":{"_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/sites\/default\/files\/manifest\/manifest_271.m3u8"}}}},"series":{"id":63,"title":"House of Cards","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/series\/63"}}},"season":{"id":65,"title":"Season 1 (2013)","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/seasons\/65"}}},"created":1447210169,"changed":1447210235},{"id":77,"label":"House Of Cards S01E01","uuid":"7ecde621-ef93-498f-996c-b6602e4faeea","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/episodes\/77"}},"body":null,"video_details":{"thumbnail":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/","manifest":{"_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/sites\/default\/files\/manifest\/manifest_329.m3u8"}}}},"series":{"id":63,"title":"House of Cards","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/series\/63"}}},"season":{"id":65,"title":"Season 1 (2013)","_links":{"self":{"href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/seasons\/65"}}},"created":1449203101,"changed":1449204524}],"count":2,"self":{"title":"Self","href":"http:\/\/admin-latest.pp.mediafoundry.com.au\/api\/v1.0\/episodes"}}
